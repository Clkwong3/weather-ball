With weather API data, develop an application that allows users to search for weather information from multiple cities and provides current weather and a 5-day projection.

## Description

This weather app allows users to see the current weather conditions as well as the 5-day projection for a number of cities. Users can access and delete their search history. The program retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on the user's city input.

## Code Breakdown

HTML: This defines the layout of the app. It includes the title, search bar, weather display, footer, and external stylesheets for google fonts and bootstrap css.

CSS: It creates the look and feel of the app, from fonts and colors to buttons and card layouts.

JS: Responsible for managing what the app does.

## Features

- Enter a city name in the search bar and press the "SEARCH" button to get weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.

- The weather data consists of the city name, date, current temperature, wind speed, humidity, and weather icon.

- Display a 5-day forecast with the date, the weather symbol, the temperature, the speed of the wind, and the humidity.

- The program stores the search history, and previous cities show up as buttons under the search field. Choosing a previous search will refresh the weather information for that city.
